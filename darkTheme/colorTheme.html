    <h2> Camel </h2>
    <p>
        A camel (from: Latin: camelus and Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Semitic: gāmāl.) is an even-toed ungulate in the
        genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.
        Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and
        felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of
        transport for passengers and cargo.
        There are three surviving species of camel.
        The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes
        up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.

    </p>
    <p>
        The word camel is also used informally in a wider sense, where the more correct term is "camelid", to include
        all seven species of the family Camelidae: the true camels (the above three species), along with the "New World"
        camelids: the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicuña, which belong to the separate tribe Lamini.
        Camelids originated in North America during the Eocene, with the ancestor of modern camels, Paracamelus,
        migrating across the Bering land bridge into Asia during the late Miocene, around 6 million years ago.
